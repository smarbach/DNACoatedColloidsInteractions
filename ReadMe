## Welcome to the program that calculates DNA Coated colloid interactions

This program was created by Sophie Marbach on August 5th, 2021
Please cite F. Cui, S. Marbach, J. A. Zheng, M. Holmes-Cerfon, D. J. Pine, to appear in Nat. Comm. 2022 if you use this software !!!

## To simulate a melting curve simply run the example in the analysis folder

To do that simply run the Launch_MeltingCurve.py with your favorite python program (located in the analysis/ folder). It should output melting curve information and an .eps plot of the melting curve. 

The program does 3 runs to refine the analysis around the melting transition that takes a total of ~1min on a standard computer. 

In command line

cd analysis/ 
python 3 Launch_MeltingCurve.py

## To just launch a potential profile calculations for your favorite DNA coated colloids then you can simply run one!

To do that run the Launch_energyProfile.py in the analysis folder. 
The program will output a plot with the energy profile and will break down the contributions between steric, binding, van der Waals etc. 

In command line

cd analysis/
python 3 Launch_energyProfile.py 

## Requirements

This code runs under python3
You may have to install lmfit
pip3 install lmfit

## other information 

The program also saves data information as defaultSave.pickle. 
In a future release we will explain how to extract further information from this pickle file such as potential profiles and so on and so forth.
