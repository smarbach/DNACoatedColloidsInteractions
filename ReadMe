## Welcome to the program that calculates DNA Coated colloid interactions

This program was created by Sophie Marbach on August 5th, 2021

## To simulate a melting curve simply run the example in the analysis folder

To do that simply run the Launch_MeltingCurve.py with your favorite python program. It should output melting curve information and an .eps plot of the melting curve. 

The program does 3 runs to refine the analysis around the melting transition that takes a total of ~1min on a standard computer. 

In command line

cd analysis/ 
python 3 Launch_MeltingCurve.py

## other information 

The program also saves data information as defaultSave.pickle. 
In a future release we will explain how to extract further information from this pickle file such as potential profiles and so on and so forth.
