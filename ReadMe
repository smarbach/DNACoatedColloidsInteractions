## Welcome to the program that calculates DNA Coated colloid interactions

This program was created by Sophie Marbach on August 5th, 2021
Please cite F. Cui, S. Marbach, J. A. Zheng, M. Holmes-Cerfon, D. J. Pine, to appear if you use this software !!!

## To simulate a melting curve simply run the example in the analysis folder

To do that simply run the Launch_MeltingCurve.py with your favorite python program. It should output melting curve information and an .eps plot of the melting curve. 

The program does 3 runs to refine the analysis around the melting transition that takes a total of ~1min on a standard computer. 

In command line

cd analysis/ 
python 3 Launch_MeltingCurve.py

## Requirements

This code runs under python3
You may have to install: lmfit, joblib
pip3 install lmfit
pip3 install joblib

## other information 

The program also saves data information as defaultSave.pickle. 
In a future release we will explain how to extract further information from this pickle file such as potential profiles and so on and so forth.
